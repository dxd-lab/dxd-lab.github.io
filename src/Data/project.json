We ran a weeklong diary with ADHD-inclusive couples to see what helps small efforts land, how talk feels safer, and how workable routines take shape. From this work, we distilled design guidelines for support tools that honor differences, ease pressure, and keep conversations clear.",

Our research explores how interactive systems can create opportunities for mindfulness in these fast-paced environments. We developed MindStock, a technical probe that introduces lightweight reflection at key moments within a simulated trading environment. Our findings reveal that the ‘cognitive friction’ from combining subjective goal-setting with objective behavioral data is a key mechanism. This approach not only reduces impulsive trading but also helps users translate reflective practices, like note-taking, into their investment behavior.",

    "description": "In personal informatics, self-reflection is essential for self-knowledge and behavior change. However, some individuals become stuck, repeatedly gaining similar insights without progress. To address this, we explored data manipulation—actively changing data values or structures—as an alternative approach. Through participatory workshops and a one-week field trial with 10 self-trackers, we applied five data manipulation methods (Insert, Delete, Transform, Increase, and Decrease). We found that data manipulation encourages behavior change by generating positive emotions and illusions, renewing self-reflection, uncovering new perspectives. However, it also risks perceptual distortion and has limited applicability, emphasizing the need for careful and balanced manipulation.",

Our study aims to examine the everyday context and underlying needs of couples in their collaborative homemaking. Through a diary study, we identified a ‘shared ritual for celebratory interaction’ as a key requirement for ideal household collaboration and pinpointed the challenges in achieving this goal. We propose three design opportunities for domestic technologies to address this gap: (1) strengthening the meaning of housework around shared family values, (2) supporting recognition of a partner’s efforts through visualization, and (3) initiating negotiation through defamiliarization.",
