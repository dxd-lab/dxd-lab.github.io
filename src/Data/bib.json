    "abstract": "As minimally verbal autistic (MVA) children communicate with parents through few words and nonverbal cues, parents often struggle to encourage their children to express subtle emotions and needs and to grasp their nuanced signals. We present AACessTalk, a tablet-based, AI-mediated communication system that facilitates meaningful exchanges between an MVA child and a parent. AACessTalk provides real-time guides to the parent to engage the child in conversation and, in turn, recommends contextual vocabulary cards to the child. Through a two-week deployment study with 11 MVA child-parent dyads, we examine how AACessTalk fosters everyday conversation practice and mutual engagement. Our findings show high engagement from all dyads, leading to increased frequency of conversation and turn-taking. AACessTalk also encouraged parents to explore their own interaction strategies and empowered the children to have more agency in communication. We discuss the implications of designing technologies for balanced communication dynamics in parent-MVA child interaction.",

    "abstract": "Household collaboration among cohabiting couples presents unique challenges due to the intimate nature of the relationships and the lack of external rewards. Current efficiency-oriented technologies neglect these distinct dynamics. Our study aims to examine the real-world context and underlying needs of couples in their collaborative homemaking. We conducted a 10-day empirical investigation involving six Korean couples, supplemented by a probe approach to facilitate reflection on their current homemaking practices. We identified the requirement for ideal household collaboration as a ’shared ritual for celebratory interaction’ and pinpointed the challenges in achieving this goal. We propose three design opportunities for domestic technology to address this gap: strengthening the meaning of housework around family values, supporting recognition of the partner’s efforts through visualization, and initiating negotiation through defamiliarization. These insights extend the design considerations for domestic technologies, advocating for a broader understanding of the values contributing to satisfactory homemaking activities within the household.",

    "abstract": "Personal informatics helps individuals understand themselves, but it often struggles to capture non-conscious behaviors such as stress responses, habitual actions, and communication styles. Incorporating social aspects into PI systems offers new perspectives on self-understanding, yet prior research has largely focused on unidirectional approaches that center benefits on the primary tracker. To address this gap, we introduce the Peerspective study, which explores reciprocal tracking—a bidirectional practice where two participants observe and provide feedback to each other, fostering mutual self-understanding and collaboration. In a week-long study with eight peer dyads, we explored how reciprocal observation and feedback influence self-awareness and interpersonal relationships. Our findings reveal that reciprocal tracking not only helps participants uncover blind spots and expand their self-concepts but also enhances empathy, deepens communication, and promotes sustained engagement. We discuss key facilitators and challenges of integrating reciprocity into personal informatics systems and offer design considerations for supporting collaborative tracking in everyday contexts.",
