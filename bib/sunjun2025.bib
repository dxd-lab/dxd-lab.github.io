    abstract = "Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA{'}s performance evolve over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student{--}VTA interaction pairs to identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these interactions with traditional student-human instructor interactions to evaluate the VTA{'}s role in the learning process. Through a large-scale empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering future advancements in AI-driven education."
