abstract = {While providing convenient market access, mobile investment applications often amplify emotional trading through features such as real-time market data and news updates. Our study explored design opportunities for AI-mediated interventions that help investors recognize their emotional biases. Through interviews with 13 investors, we examined how emotions emerge throughout the investment process, how they are reflected in investment behavior, and whether emotion-based interventions can be effective. Our findings revealed that participants experienced recurring cycles of impulsive decisions driven by anxiety, overconfidence, and immediate reward-seeking, which persisted due to intermittent successes and platform convenience. They preferred objective data over directive interventions and valued real-time support that preserves autonomy and retrospective analysis capabilities for long-term improvement. Drawing on these insights, we propose a design concept featuring data-driven reflection mechanisms that help users recognize deviations from established investment patterns. Our work highlights opportunities for adaptive, reflection-oriented AI interventions explicitly tailored to investors’ emotional awareness.},
