abstract = {Short-form videos on platforms like YouTube Shorts provide accessible entertainment and quick information. Yet, excessive consumption can lead to psychological, cognitive, and emotional side effects. To design interventions that seamlessly integrate balanced short-form video consumption into daily routines, understanding how users engage with these videos in their everyday lives is crucial. However, few studies have qualitatively explored users’ daily interactions with short-form videos. To this end, we conducted a four-day diary study with eight active users. Our findings show that users watch videos during brief breaks or moments of mental fatigue, appreciating the value of short-form videos in their everyday lives. However, they often lose awareness of their viewing, passively consume content, and struggle to recall any videos afterward, which leads to regret and self-blame. Drawing from these insights, we propose a holistic intervention aimed at supporting more mindful and balanced consumption that naturally fits within users’ existing routines.},
